# ESILV-A3-Final-Project

## Presentation

This project was made during my first academic year in engineering classes.
The goal was to create an IA that could battle against an human on the Tic-Tac-Toe game and also on the Connect 4. Beside exams, work and homework we had around a semester to invest in that project. We thought at first we would use [bit-boards](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitboard) as it was way faster to execute and we had constraints for the algorithm to make a move in a reasonable time. As the deadline approached, we felt that we wouldn't be able to make it and went for a simple implementation using arrays. It's slower but it did the work.


## Usage

Simply execute main.py in any of the directory and follow the instructions.
